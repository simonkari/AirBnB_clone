# AirBnB_clone
![AirBnB](logo.png)
This is a python AirBnB clone project. This is part 1 of our AirBnb Clone project. The purpose of this project is to make a command interpreter that manages all the objects within the application.


## The Goal
To be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Usage
The Commandline Interpreter can be started by executing the command `./console.py`. The `console` can `create`, `destroy`, and `update` objects. Type `help` within the console to get a list of command options and its function.

**Example:**
```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  create  help  quit

Undocumented commands:
======================
all  destroy  show  update

(hbnb) help quit
Quit command to exit the program
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in non-interactive model:
```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$

```
